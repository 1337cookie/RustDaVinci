# TODO

## Coding
- Add help tags to all the modules in the gui?
- Create build script to make it easy to create windows executable.
- Setup CI travis yml
- NEXT TIME: Fix default color in rustdavinci file, it is fixed in settings now


## Testing
- Test different settings for paintings (click_delay, line_delay etc...). See what settings is the most optimal.
- Investigate how the application work together with the rust application. Will Rust minimize when switched to rustdavinci? Make it possible to set rustdavinci on top while painting? etc...
- Check accuracy for the estimation of time.


## Other
- Get Facepunch and EAC to recognize this application and what it is capable of doing. Contact them.
- Create a howto/ tutorial guide.
- Add more to FAQ

# Potentially big todos
- Try to lower the calculation time for statistics. At the moment it is very long...
