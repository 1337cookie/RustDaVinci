- Check accuracy for the estimation of time.
- Get Facepunch and EAC to recognize this application and what it is capable of doing. Contact them.

- Add more to FAQ
- Create build script to make it easy to create windows executable.
- Investigate what is the best way to create a windows executable.
- Make it possible to exit area capturing mode by clicking any key or perhaps ESC?
- Investigate how to handle setting the pause, skip and exit button. As of now, the values are hardcoded (F10, F11, ESC)

- Fix the settings about tab, add more information to it.
- Check what more settings would be appropriate.
