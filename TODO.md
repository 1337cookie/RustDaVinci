# TODO

- Test different settings for paintings (click_delay, line_delay etc...)
- Check accuracy for the estimation of time
- Get Facepunch and EAC to recognize this application and what it is capable of doing.
- Fix all the spaghetti code
- Optimize rustDaVinci class functions and investigate the proper way to handle variables inside classes, should I use global class variables or local variables in the function?
- Extend the GUI to show the Image preview and original. Perhaps right click to switch between them.
- Investigate the exact settings needed and appropriate

## New features

- Create a howto guide
- Set the window topmost (as an overlay to Rust) then remove topmost when paint is done
- Perhaps hide window when painting. Or show progress.
- Add more FAQ
- Play around with the hidden colors (Needs to be SUPER accurate for it to work)
- Make the palette implementation more smart. So it does not depend on the position of the colors.
- Investigate in Nuitka for avoiding decomplie the executable. (Is it really necessary?)
