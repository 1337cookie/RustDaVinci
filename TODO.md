# TODO

- Test different settings for paintings (click_delay, line_delay etc...)
- Check accuracy for the estimation of time
- Get Facepunch and EAC to recognize this application and what it is capable of doing.
- Implement GUI with pyQt5

## New features

- Create a howto guide
- Set the window topmost (as an overlay to Rust) then remove topmost when paint is done
- Create a FAQ file
- Play around with the hidden colors (Needs to be SUPER accurate for it to work)
- Make the palette implementation more smart. So it does not depend on the position of the colors.
- Investigate in Nuitka for avoiding decomplie the executable. (Is it really necessary?)


## Optimization

- Optimize area capturing, find another way to capture the tool area and painting area.


## Test
- Test the min_pixels_for_line variable, which value is the most optimal? atm 7


## Known errors
