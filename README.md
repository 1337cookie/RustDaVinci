Automatic Sign Painter for Rust


## TODO
- Get Facepunch and EAC to recognize this application and what it is capable of doing.

- Optimize area capturing, find another way to capture the tool area and painting area.
- Maybe tweak the image generation, less pixels?
- Create a howto guide
- Set the window topmost (as an overlay to Rust)
- Automatically update the painting when switching colors
- Test the line painting speed, is it satisfactory? Does everything get painted? Missing pixels?
- Optimize the estimate time part
